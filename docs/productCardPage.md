#### <span class="custom-heading">Logic Explanation</span>

1. Check if the product is already in the cart:
   - Uses `currentCart.indexOf(producer.get("name"))` to determine if the product is in the cart.
   - If not in the cart (`-1`), it adds the product to the cart.
   - If in the cart, it removes the product.

2. Handle wallet updates:
   - Deducts the product price (and warranty cost, if applicable) when adding a product.
   - Refunds the product price (and warranty cost, if applicable) when removing a product.

3. Update the cart and wallet:
   - Uses `player.set("cart", currentCart)` to update the cart.
   - Uses `player.set("wallet", player.get("wallet") Â± productPrice)` to update the wallet balance.

4. Notifications:
   - Displays a toast message indicating whether the product was added or removed from the cart.

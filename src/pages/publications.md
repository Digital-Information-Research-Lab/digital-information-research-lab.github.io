- [Secure Account Recovery for a Privacy-Preserving Web Service](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-little.pdf)   
  **Authors:** Ryan Little, Lucy Qin, and Mayank Varia   
  **Abstract:** This paper presents a cryptographic protocol for secure account recovery in a privacy-preserving web service, ensuring that users can recover their accounts without revealing personal data to the provider. The proposed system leverages standardized cryptographic techniques, including an oblivious pseudorandom function, to enable secure email-based validation while preventing unauthorized access.

- **Improving the Governance of Digital Platforms with Interactive Marketplace Experiments**  
  *International Conference on Computational Social Science, 2024*    
  **Authors:** Swapneel Mehta, Sverre Wiedswang, Zoey Yang, Nina Mazar, Marshall van Alstyne  
  **Abstract:** An empirical experiment discussed in our extended abstract for IC2S2, 2024 where we present our findings from the deployment of self-certification, or truth warrants in a competitive two-sided e-commerce marketplace.

- **Market Design Interventions for Safer Agentic AI**  
  **Authors:** Swapneel Mehta, Aaron Nichols, Abhishek Shah, Pratyay Banerjee, Nina Mazar, Marshall van Alstyne  
  **Abstract:**  In this paper, we run an empirical study with human buyers purchasing products based on ads generated by large language model ‘agents’ to find an increase in misleading advertising and consumer harm. Using our novel economic intervention we demonstrate how to curtail deception by dishonest agentic advertisers while improving the profits of honest ones using truth warrants.

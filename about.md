<h2>About us </h2>
<!-- We are a group of data scientists with interest in brains and, more general, biomedical research. Our research is more diverse than most labs, and also changes much more quickly! Right at the moment, much of the research in the lab is about deep learning and its applications. We also do a good bit of neural data analysis. Right now we are also very much interested in causality and its links with machine learning. -->

<!-- ### Research
Van Alstyne MW. Free Speech and the Fake News Problem. Available at SSRN 4414261. 2023 Apr 10. -->

<p>The Platform Governance Research Lab (PGRL) focuses on using market-level design, message-level design, and human factors to address the problem of misinformation. Our team is dedicated to discovering how we can curb fake news while protecting free speech through innovative interventions, market mechanisms, and legal reforms.</p>

<h2>Research Goals</h2>
<p>Our research aims to address misinformation through a multifaceted approach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using market-level design to reduce false claims and promote honesty.</li>
    <li>Promote free expression without any form of censorship or even central parties judging speech.</li>
    <li>Applying cognitive psychology to understand and influence beliefs and trust.</li>
    <li>Conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test interventions and measure their impact.</li>
    <li>Exploring the potential for market design to inform legal reforms, particularly updating ยง230 and content liability laws.</li>
</ul>

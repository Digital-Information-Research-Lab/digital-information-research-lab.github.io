### Bio
Tejovan is a Phd student in Computing and Data Science at Boston University. He is interested in using computational models of the interactions of incentivized agents to understand how the structures and rules of specific socio-economic systems result in systemic patterns and overall social outcomes. He hopes to use this to design and support better policies. Tejovan has a BS/MS in mechanical engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder.

### Bio
Abhishek Shah is a senior at Green Level High School, who is passionate about technology, artificial intelligence and cyber security. He is the founder and creator of AuralStudio, a pioneering platform that reimagines computer science for the visually-impaired, and the developer of corresponding programming language Rattle, designed to be heard. He has also been the co-founder of the EXPLORE Summer Program, where he raised over $6000 for COVID-19 relief and to provide laptops to visually-impaired students. Abhishek was selected to attend the 2024 Beaver Works Summer Institute program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he learnt from distinguished researchers, industry professionals and leading executives in the areas of technology, leadership and economics.

His work in AuralStudio has been recognized with a second place grand award from Microsoft at the 2024 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, the 25th anniversary award from IEEE, and a first place award in Youth Education from USAID. He became the youngest recipient of the Kaufmann Best Student Paper Award at the 2024 Southern Association for Information Systems Conference for his paper modeling the impact of influencer messaging on COVID-19 vaccine perception, which was subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal. He is also an avid pianist, having performed at various concert halls, universities and retirement homes and enjoys playing and watching tennis in his free time.

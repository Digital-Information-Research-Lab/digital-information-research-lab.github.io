### Bio
Hi, I’m Lauren! I am a second-year at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science, with a focus on systems and architecture + information. In Summer 2024, I worked with my team to test, build out, and deploy one-player games on the consumer side. I’m excited to continue developing my skills as a software engineer who creates technology for innovation, social good, and fun!

### Bio
Im Tony Ponomarev and I’m a rising senior here at BU studying computer science and math! I’ve spent a lot of my time developing the backend code for a version of the game that involves multiple humans playing against one another. I spend a lot of my free time hanging out with friends, playing basketball, and swimming competitively.
